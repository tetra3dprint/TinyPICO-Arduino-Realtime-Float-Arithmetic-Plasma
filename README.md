# TinyPICO-Arduino-Realtime-Float-Arithmetic-Plasma
Ardunio IDE TinyPICO code

A simple "Plasma Effect" demonstration on a 64 x 64 LED Matrix

The code is not efficient, but does make use of some lookup tables to speed some things up.
This could be sped up with pure integer arithmetics and supporting lookup tables, but that would make the code a bit harder to play with and follow.

The pallet is an array of RGB565 values that I created using another script. Just replace those values for custom pallets.
360 is a magic number of values here.

I've included my attempt at an accurate FPS counter (Â± a couple FPS :)
It shuold report a true frame count per 1000 milliseconds. It works quite well for testing code execution cost.
Just comment out #define SHOW_FPS

Additionally if you uncomment //#define BASIC_FPS_TEST this will just fill the Matrix with a fixed color instead of running the Plasma Effect. The idea of this is to guesstimates max realistic fps( if shown) in the current enviroment and implementation.

I was getting 88 fps in test mode and the Plasma averaged around 46 fps

If you use this code then make sure you configure PxMatrix correctly for your LED Matrix

Required hardware/software: -

Arduino IDE with ESP32 support installed https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32#installation-instructions

LED Matrix - I got one from AliExpress
